AI-Driven Sales Data Analysis for Inventory Optimization
Overview
This project implements an intelligent system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze sales data for optimizing inventory management. The core objective is to minimize issues such as overstocking and understocking, thereby improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing overall profitability for businesses. By accurately forecasting demand and managing stock levels, the system aims to provide data-driven insights for smarter inventory decisions.

Features
Sales Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of historical sales patterns, trends, and seasonality.

Demand Forecasting: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., time-series models like ARIMA, or other ML algorithms) to predict future sales demand.

Inventory Level Optimization: Recommends optimal stock levels to prevent stockouts and reduce excess inventory.

Performance Metrics: Tracks key inventory performance indicators (KPIs) such as stock turnover, lead time, and carrying costs.

Visualization of Insights: Presents complex data and optimization recommendations through intuitive charts and dashboards.

Reporting & Alerts: Generates reports and triggers alerts for low stock, potential overstock, or significant demand shifts.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for various ML algorithms), potentially specific libraries for time-series forecasting (e.g., statsmodels for ARIMA, Prophet)

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Database Integration: (Likely SQL or NoSQL database for sales data storage, though not explicitly detailed in the PDF beyond "data collection")

Web Framework/Dashboarding: (Could be Flask, Streamlit, or integration with BI tools like Power BI, depending on implementation choices)
